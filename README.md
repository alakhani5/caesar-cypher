# caesar-cypher
Wrote up a caesar cypher in JS

Goal of this project was to get a better understanding of some of the basics of JS
Specifically: functions, for loops, scopes of variables, and string manipulation

Summary: 
A Caesar Cypher takes a string input and shifts it to output a string that has each character adjusted in a certain way.

e.g., If give 'abc' and told to shift the characters by 2 indexes to the right, it would output 'cde'

The complexity of this particular project is meant to serve as a foundation upon which I could better understand how to build functions, how to take arguments within those functions, and ultimately produce a meaningful result that accomplishes the task at hand.

This project introduced me to a few basic concepts of JS and let me apply them in a slightly interesting way
- Understanding a problem in a structured way
- Looking for edge cases (what if there is a z and I am expected to shift 1 or more characters over or "wrap" around the alphabet?) 
- Outputting a useful function
